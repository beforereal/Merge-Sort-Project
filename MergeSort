# Example Of Merge Sort Steps

> Example Array = [16,21,11,8,12,22]


### Divide into arrays


* [16,21,11]  [8,12,22]
* [16] [21,11] [8] [12,22]
* [16] [21] [11] [8] [12] [22]

### Merge arrays by sorting

> Merge arrays together by sorting from small to big one so we make less operations.

* [16] [21] [11] [8] [12] [22]

* [16,21]  [18] [11] [12,22]

> When we merge arrays with multiple elements we check first elements to merge than eliminate that we choose and write into new array and check next component. <br>

   SO if we want to merge [16,21] [18] check first 16<18 (yes) then check 21<18 <br>

* [16,18,21] [11,12,22] <br>

> So if we do same procedure for those 2 arrays final array becomes this <br>
[11,12,16,18,21,22]


## BIG O Notation

> O(n*log(n))
